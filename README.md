Perception is probably one of the most important things when we talk about autonomy.

This is performed by robots using the ROS Framework.

At the end of this course you will feel comfortable about making robots do the following things:

  1. Track objects by their color blobs

  2. Navigate following floor lines with only the RGB camera

  3. Detect human faces and track them

  4. Recognize different faces

  5. Track a person through a 3D environment

  6. Recognize flat surfaces like tables where objects might be placed

  7. Recognize objects and track them in 3D space with PointCloudSensors

  8. Use Yolo for object recognition and tracking in 3D space
