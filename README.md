Track objects by its color blobs

Navigate following floor lines with only RGB camera

Detect human faces and track them

Recognize different faces

Track a person through a 3D environment

Recognize flat surfaces like tables where object might be placed

Recognize objects and track them in 3D space with PointCloudSensors

Use Yolo for object recognition and tracking in 3D space
